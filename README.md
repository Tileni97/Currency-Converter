# Mastermind Game

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where the player tries to guess a secret code consisting of a series of colors. This version of the game is implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Random Code Generation**: The secret code is randomly generated each game, ensuring a unique challenge every time.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The game features an intuitive GUI built with `tkinter`.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: After each guess, the player receives feedback on the number of correct colors in the correct positions and correct colors in incorrect positions.
- **Multiple Attempts**: The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the code.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the Python script.
2. Enter your guess by typing the colors in the provided entry fields.
3. Click the "Submit Guess" button to see the feedback.
4. Continue guessing until you either guess the code correctly or run out of attempts.
5. A message will display your success or the correct code if you fail to guess it within the allowed attempts.

## Installation
